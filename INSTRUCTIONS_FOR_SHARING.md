## 💬 What to Tell Your Friends

### Short Version:
```
Hey! Want to try my LibHub project?

1. Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Clone: git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> LibHub
3. Run: cd LibHub && setup-windows.bat

### Detailed Version:
```
I've made it super easy to run LibHub on Windows:

Prerequisites (one-time):
- Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Setup (3 commands):
1. git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> LibHub
2. cd LibHub
3. setup-windows.bat

Wait 3-5 minutes (first time only), then go to http://localhost:8080

The setup script will:
✅ Check if Docker is running
✅ Build all services
✅ Start everything (MySQL, Consul, 3 microservices, Gateway, Frontend)
✅ Run health checks
✅ Show you the URLs

If you have issues, check FOR_WINDOWS_USERS.md in the repo.
```

## 📋 What Your Friends Get

When they run `setup-windows.bat`, they get:

1. **MySQL Database** - All data storage
2. **Consul** - Service discovery dashboard (http://localhost:8500)
3. **UserService** - Authentication and user management
4. **CatalogService** - Book catalog (15 books pre-loaded)
5. **LoanService** - Borrowing and returns with Saga pattern
6. **API Gateway** - Routes all requests
7. **Frontend** - Modern web UI (http://localhost:8080)

All running in Docker containers, fully connected and working!
