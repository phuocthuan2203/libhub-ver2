## Test Coverage

### Scenario 1: Customer Happy Path ✅
**Status**: Fully implemented with Playwright

**Validates**:
- User registration in user_db
- JWT token generation and storage
- Book catalog browsing and search
- Distributed Saga transaction (loan_db + catalog_db)
- Stock decrement on borrow
- Stock increment on return
- Loan status transitions (CheckedOut → Returned)

### Scenarios 2-5: Database Verification Queries ✅
**Status**: SQL queries ready for manual/automated verification

**Coverage**:
- Admin CRUD operations
- Saga compensating transactions
- Max loan limit enforcement
- Overdue loan detection

---

## Key Features

### 1. Database Integration
- Direct MySQL connection from Playwright tests
- Real-time verification of database state
- Saga transaction validation across multiple databases

### 2. JWT Authentication
- Token storage in localStorage
- Token injection for authenticated requests
- Login flow validation

### 3. Page Interactions
- Form filling and submission
- Navigation assertions
- Element visibility checks
- Dynamic content validation

### 4. Saga Pattern Validation
- Verifies loan creation in loan_db
- Verifies stock decrement in catalog_db
- Validates atomic transaction behavior
- Tests compensating transactions

---

## Dependencies

### NPM Packages
```json
{
  "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0",

---

## Execution Instructions

### Setup
```bash
cd tests/e2e
npm install

mysql -u libhub_user -p < test-data-setup.sql
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Headless mode
npm run test:headed      # With browser UI
npm run test:debug       # Debug mode
npm run test:ui          # Playwright UI mode
npm run report           # View test report
```

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. Implement Playwright tests for Scenarios 2-5
2. Add CI/CD pipeline integration
3. Add performance testing
4. Add visual regression testing
5. Add API contract testing

### Test Execution
1. Populate test data: `mysql -u libhub_user -p < test-data-setup.sql`
2. Start all services (UserService, CatalogService, LoanService, Gateway, Frontend)
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. View report: `npm run report`

## Notes

- Test data uses ISBN pattern `9999*` for easy identification
- BCrypt hashes in test-data-setup.sql are placeholders (need real hashes)
- Tests run sequentially to avoid data conflicts
- Database connection credentials hardcoded (consider environment variables)
