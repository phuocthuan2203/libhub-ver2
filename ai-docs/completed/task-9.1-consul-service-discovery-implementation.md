# Consul Service Discovery - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Implemented and Tested

## Summary

Successfully implemented Consul service discovery pattern for LibHub microservices project, replacing hardcoded service addresses with dynamic service registration and discovery.

## Test Results

```
1. Checking Consul availability...
   ✓ Consul is running

2. Listing registered services...
   - catalogservice
   - consul
   - loanservice
   - userservice

3. Checking service health...
   ✓ userservice: 1 healthy instance(s)
   ✓ catalogservice: 1 healthy instance(s)
   ✓ loanservice: 1 healthy instance(s)

4. Testing service endpoints...
   ✓ UserService health OK
   ✓ CatalogService health OK
   ✓ LoanService health OK

5. Testing Gateway routing through Consul...
   ✓ Gateway routing works (HTTP 200)

6. Service instance details...
   - userservice: userservice:5002 - passing
   - catalogservice: catalogservice:5001 - passing
   - loanservice: loanservice:5003 - passing
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Infrastructure Changes

**Added Consul Container**
- Image: `consul:1.15`
- Ports: 8500 (HTTP/UI), 8600 (DNS)
- Mode: Single-node development server with UI

### 2. Service Registration

Each microservice now:
- Registers with Consul on startup
- Provides health check endpoint at `/health`
- Deregisters on graceful shutdown
- Uses unique service ID with GUID

**Health Check Configuration**
- Interval: 10 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Deregister after: 1 minute of critical status

### 3. Gateway Configuration

**Ocelot Changes**
- Removed hardcoded `DownstreamHostAndPorts`
- Added `ServiceName` for Consul lookup
- Configured `LoadBalancerOptions` with RoundRobin
- Added Consul provider configuration

### 4. NuGet Packages Added

**Services**
- `Consul` v1.7.14.3

**Gateway**
- `Ocelot.Provider.Consul` v20.0.*

## Files Created

1. `/src/Services/UserService/LibHub.UserService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
2. `/src/Services/CatalogService/LibHub.CatalogService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
3. `/src/Services/LoanService/LibHub.LoanService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
4. `/CONSUL_SERVICE_DISCOVERY.md` - Documentation
5. `/scripts/test-consul-discovery.sh` - Test script

## Files Modified

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Added Consul service and environment variables
2. `src/Gateway/LibHub.Gateway.Api/ocelot.json` - Consul service discovery config
3. `src/Gateway/LibHub.Gateway.Api/Program.cs` - Added Consul provider
4. All service `Program.cs` files - Added health checks and Consul registration
5. All service `.csproj` files - Added Consul package reference

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Hardcoded)
```
Gateway → http://userservice:5002
Gateway → http://catalogservice:5001
Gateway → http://loanservice:5003
```

### After (Dynamic Discovery)
```
Gateway → Consul → [userservice instances]
Gateway → Consul → [catalogservice instances]
Gateway → Consul → [loanservice instances]
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic Service Discovery**
   - No hardcoded service addresses
   - Services discovered at runtime

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Automatic health checks every 10 seconds
   - Unhealthy instances automatically excluded

3. **Load Balancing**
   - RoundRobin distribution across instances
   - Ready for horizontal scaling

4. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Automatic failover to healthy instances
   - Graceful service deregistration

5. **Observability**
   - Consul UI at http://localhost:8500
   - Real-time service status monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Start Services
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### View Consul UI
```
http://localhost:8500
```

### Test Service Discovery
```bash
./scripts/test-consul-discovery.sh
```

### Scale a Service
```bash
docker compose up -d --scale userservice=3
```

### Check Service Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/health/service/userservice
```

### Query Registered Services
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/services
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check all services are registered
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/services | jq .

# Check specific service health
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/health/service/userservice?passing | jq .

# Test Gateway routing
curl http://localhost:5000/api/books

# Check service health endpoints
curl http://localhost:5002/health  # UserService
curl http://localhost:5001/health  # CatalogService
curl http://localhost:5003/health  # LoanService
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Advanced Health Checks**
   - Add database connectivity checks
   - Add external dependency checks

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Implement Polly for resilience
   - Add retry policies

3. **Service Mesh**
   - Consider Istio or Linkerd for advanced features
   - Add distributed tracing

4. **Multi-Instance Testing**
   - Scale services horizontally
   - Test load balancing behavior

5. **Production Configuration**
   - Multi-node Consul cluster
   - Persistent storage for Consul data
   - TLS/SSL for Consul communication

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Service Not Registering
1. Check service logs: `docker logs libhub-userservice`
2. Verify Consul is running: `docker ps | grep consul`
3. Check health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5002/health`

### Gateway Cannot Find Service
1. Verify service in Consul UI: http://localhost:8500
2. Check Ocelot config has correct ServiceName
3. Ensure Gateway has Consul connection configured

### Health Check Failing
1. Verify `/health` endpoint responds
2. Check network connectivity
3. Review health check configuration

## Conclusion

Consul service discovery has been successfully implemented and tested. All services are:
- ✅ Registering with Consul
- ✅ Passing health checks
- ✅ Discoverable by Gateway
- ✅ Routing requests correctly

The system is now ready for horizontal scaling and provides better fault tolerance and observability.
