# LibHub Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the LibHub project. The documentation is structured in 5 progressive layers, each building on the previous one to help you understand how the system works from high-level concepts down to specific code implementation.

## Reading Order

Read these documents in sequence for the best learning experience:

### Layer 0: Foundation
**File:** `../../ai-docs/master-context/00_PROJEC$$T_CONTEXT.md`

Start here to understand the project's purpose, technology stack, and high-level architecture patterns.

### Layer 1: System Overview
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_LAYER1_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`

Learn about:
- All 5 system components (Frontend, Gateway, 3 microservices)
- Network architecture and port mapping
- Basic request flow diagrams
- Database per service pattern
- Docker deployment structure

**Time to read:** 15-20 minutes

### Layer 2: UserService Deep Dive
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_LAYER2_USERSERVICE_DEEP_DIVE.md`

Understand Clean Architecture through UserService:
- 4-layer architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- How each layer works with code examples
- Data flow through layers
- Why dependencies point inward
- Register and Login workflows

**Time to read:** 30-40 minutes

### Layer 3: Dependency Flow & Injection
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_LAYER3_DEPENDENCY_FLOW.md`

Learn how everything wires together:
- Dependency injection in ASP.NET Core
- Service lifetimes (Scoped, Singleton, Transient)
- Request lifecycle from HTTP to database
- Middleware pipeline
- Configuration management

**Time to read:** 25-35 minutes

### Layer 4: Inter-Service Communication
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_LAYER4_INTER_SERVICE_COMMUNICATION.md`

Explore distributed systems patterns:
- HTTP-based service communication
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Compensating transactions
- Service discovery with Consul
- Error handling strategies

**Time to read:** 35-45 minutes

### Layer 5: Complete Data Flow Examples
**File:** `ARCHITECTURE_LAYER5_DATA_FLOW_EXAMPLES.md`

Walk through real scenarios:
- User registration (complete code trace)
- Borrow book with Saga pattern
- Saga failure with rollback
- Data transformation at each layer
- JWT token flow

**Time to read:** 40-50 minutes

## Total Learning Time

**Estimated:** 2.5 - 3 hours for complete understanding

## Visual Diagrams

All documents include Mermaid diagrams that render in most markdown viewers:
- System architecture diagrams
- Sequence diagrams for request flows
- State machines for domain entities
- Dependency injection graphs
- Saga orchestration flows

## Code References

Documents reference actual source code with file paths:
- `src/Services/UserService/` - UserService implementation
- `src/Services/CatalogService/` - CatalogService implementation
- `src/Services/LoanService/` - LoanService with Saga pattern
- `src/Gateway/` - Ocelot API Gateway
- `frontend/` - Vanilla JavaScript frontend

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
- Independent services with separate databases
- HTTP/REST communication
- Service discovery with Consul

### Clean Architecture (per service)
- Domain Layer (business rules, zero dependencies)
- Application Layer (use case orchestration)
- Infrastructure Layer (technical implementation)
- Presentation Layer (HTTP API)

### Saga Pattern
- Distributed transactions across services
- Compensating transactions for rollback
- PENDING â†’ CheckedOut or FAILED state flow

### Database Per Service
- Each service owns its database
- No foreign key constraints between services
- Data consistency via Saga pattern

## Learning Objectives

After reading all 5 layers, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the overall system architecture and how components interact
2. **Trace** a request from frontend through all layers to database and back
3. **Understand** why Clean Architecture separates concerns into layers
4. **Implement** new features following established patterns
5. **Debug** issues by identifying which layer is responsible
6. **Appreciate** trade-offs in distributed systems design
7. **Recognize** how Saga pattern maintains consistency across services
