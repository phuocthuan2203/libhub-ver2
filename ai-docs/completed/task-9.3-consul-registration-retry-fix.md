# Consul Service Registration - Retry Logic & Error Handling Fix

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Branch**: `feat/registering-to-consul`  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Implemented and Tested

## Summary

Fixed critical Consul registration issues by implementing retry logic with exponential backoff, comprehensive logging, and graceful error handling. Services now reliably register with Consul even when Consul takes time to become available during startup.

## Problem Identified

### Original Issue
Services were failing to register with Consul during startup, causing:
- Silent registration failures (no logging)
- Connection refused errors when Consul wasn't ready
- Application crashes during shutdown when trying to deregister
- No retry mechanism for transient failures

### Error Logs (Before Fix)
```
crit: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.ApplicationLifetime[7]
      An error occurred stopping the application
      System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (Connection refused (consul:8500))
```

### Root Causes
1. **No Retry Logic**: Single registration attempt with `.Wait()` blocking call
2. **No Logging**: Silent failures - impossible to debug
3. **Timing Issues**: Services starting before Consul was ready
4. **Blocking Registration**: Registration blocked app startup
5. **Unsafe Deregistration**: No timeout or error handling on shutdown

## Solution Implemented

### Key Improvements

1. **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic**
   - 5 retry attempts with increasing delays
   - Delays: 2s → 5s → 10s → 15s → 30s
   - Total retry window: ~62 seconds

2. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Registration attempt logs with attempt number
   - Success logs with service details
   - Warning logs for retries
   - Error logs for final failures

3. **Async Background Registration**
   - Non-blocking registration using `Task.Run()`
   - App starts immediately, registration happens in background
   - No impact on startup time

4. **Graceful Error Handling**
   - Services continue running even if Consul unavailable
   - Safe deregistration with timeout protection
   - Proper exception handling throughout

5. **Enhanced Observability**
   - Clear log messages for troubleshooting
   - Service ID tracking
   - Attempt counting

## Files Modified

### 1. UserService
**File**: `/src/Services/UserService/LibHub.UserService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
- Added `RetryDelays` array for exponential backoff
- Implemented `RegisterWithRetryAsync()` method
- Added logger injection
- Converted to async background registration
- Added timeout to deregistration

**File**: `/src/Services/UserService/LibHub.UserService.Api/Program.cs`
- Added startup log message

### 2. CatalogService
**File**: `/src/Services/CatalogService/LibHub.CatalogService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
- Same improvements as UserService
- Service name: `catalogservice`
- Default port: 5001

### 3. LoanService
**File**: `/src/Services/LoanService/LibHub.LoanService.Api/Extensions/ConsulServiceRegistration.cs`
- Same improvements as UserService
- Service name: `loanservice`
- Default port: 5003

## Implementation Details

### Retry Configuration
```csharp
private static readonly TimeSpan[] RetryDelays = 
{
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2),   // Attempt 1 retry
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),   // Attempt 2 retry
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),  // Attempt 3 retry
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15),  // Attempt 4 retry
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)   // Attempt 5 retry
};
```

### Registration Flow
```csharp
Task.Run(async () =>
{
    await RegisterWithRetryAsync(consulClient, registration, logger, serviceId, serviceName);
});
```

### Safe Deregistration
```csharp
lifetime.ApplicationStopping.Register(() =>
{
    try
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Deregistering service {ServiceId} from Consul", serviceId);
        consulClient.Agent.ServiceDeregister(serviceId).Wait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        logger.LogInformation("Successfully deregistered service {ServiceId} from Consul", serviceId);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        logger.LogWarning(ex, "Failed to deregister service {ServiceId} from Consul", serviceId);
    }
});
```

## Test Results

### ✅ Single Instance Test

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Service Not Registering

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker logs libhub-userservice-1 2>&1 | grep -i consul
```

**Expected output:**
```
Attempting to register service userservice (ID: ...) with Consul (Attempt 1/5)
Successfully registered service userservice (ID: ...) with Consul at userservice:5002
```

**If seeing retry attempts:**
- Consul might be slow to start
- Wait for all 5 attempts to complete
- Check Consul is running: `docker ps | grep consul`

### Issue: Connection Refused Errors

**Check Consul status:**
```bash
docker ps | grep consul
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/status/leader
```

**Restart Consul:**
```bash
docker compose restart consul
sleep 5
docker compose restart userservice catalogservice loanservice
```

### Issue: Service Shows as Unhealthy

**Check health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5002/health  # UserService
curl http://localhost:5001/health  # CatalogService
curl http://localhost:5003/health  # LoanService
```

**Check Consul health checks:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/v1/health/service/userservice | jq '.[] | .Checks'
```

### Issue: Multiple Instances Not Registering

**Check container status:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Check each instance logs:**
```bash
docker logs libhub-userservice-1 2>&1 | tail -20
docker logs libhub-userservice-2 2>&1 | tail -20
docker logs libhub-userservice-3 2>&1 | tail -20
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Before Fix
```
Service Startup → Consul Registration (blocking) → FAIL (no retry)
                                                 → App Crashes
```

### After Fix
```
Service Startup → Background Registration → Retry 1 (2s delay)
                                          → Retry 2 (5s delay)
                                          → Retry 3 (10s delay)
                                          → Retry 4 (15s delay)
                                          → Retry 5 (30s delay)
                                          → Success ✓ / Graceful Failure
                                          
App continues running regardless of registration status
```
