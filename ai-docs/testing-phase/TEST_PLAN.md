# LibHub - System Integration & Testing Plan

**Phase**: 7 - System Integration & Testing  
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: All phases 1-6 complete, all services deployed

---

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify end-to-end user workflows work correctly
2. Validate Saga pattern for distributed transactions
3. Ensure system meets performance requirements (200 concurrent users, <2s search)
4. Verify security controls (JWT, RBAC, password hashing)
5. Test system resilience under failure conditions

---

## Test Environment

**Services Running**:
- UserService: localhost:5002
- CatalogService: localhost:5001
- LoanService: localhost:5003
- Gateway: localhost:5000
- Frontend: file:///.../frontend/index.html

**Databases**:
- user_db (MySQL 8.0)
- catalog_db (MySQL 8.0)
- loan_db (MySQL 8.0)

---

## Testing Strategy

**Approach**: Incremental testing (bottom-up)
1. API Contract Testing (verify all endpoints work)
2. E2E Testing (verify user journeys)
3. Performance Testing (load testing)
4. Security Testing (penetration testing)
5. Resilience Testing (failure scenarios)

**Test Execution**: Manual + Automated scripts
**Bug Tracking**: Document in PROJECT_STATUS.md
**Acceptance**: All critical bugs fixed before sign-off

---

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- All user workflows (register, login, browse, borrow, return)
- All admin workflows (CRUD books, view loans)
- Saga distributed transactions
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Performance under load
- Security vulnerabilities
- Failure recovery mechanisms

### Out of Scope
- UI/UX design testing
- Browser compatibility (stick to Chrome)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Internationalization
- Third-party service integrations

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All E2E scenarios pass (5/5)
- [ ] All API endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] System handles 200 concurrent users
- [ ] Search responds in <2 seconds
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Saga compensating transactions work
- [ ] System recovers from service failures

---

## Test Deliverables

1. Completed test scenarios with pass/fail results
2. Bug reports with severity and status
3. Performance test results with metrics
4. Security test report
5. Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md with testing completion
6. Sign-off document

## Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Owner |
|----------|----------|-------|
| API Contract Testing | 1 day | You |
| E2E Testing | 2 days | You |
| Performance Testing | 1 day | You |
| Security Testing | 1 day | You |
| Resilience Testing | 1 day | You |
| Bug Fixing | 2-3 days | You + AI |
| Regression Testing | 1 day | You |

**Total**: 7-10 days

---

## Risk Management

**High Risks**:
- Saga pattern failures (compensating transactions)
- Performance under concurrent load
- Database connection pool exhaustion

**Mitigation**:
- Test Saga thoroughly with network failures
- Use JMeter for load testing
- Configure connection pool limits

---

## Exit Criteria

Testing complete when:
- All test scenarios executed
- No critical bugs open
- Performance requirements met
- Security audit passed
- All documentation updated
