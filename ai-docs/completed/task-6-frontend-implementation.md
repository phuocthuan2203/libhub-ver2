## Frontend Structure

```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                  # Book catalog (public)
â”œâ”€â”€ book-detail.html            # Book details (public)
â”œâ”€â”€ login.html                  # Login page
â”œâ”€â”€ register.html               # Registration page
â”œâ”€â”€ my-loans.html              # User loans (authenticated)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-catalog.html         # Manage books (admin)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-add-book.html        # Add book form (admin)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-edit-book.html       # Edit book form (admin)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-loans.html           # All loans (admin)
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css             # Global styles
â””â”€â”€ js/
    â”œâ”€â”€ api-client.js          # API wrapper
    â””â”€â”€ auth.js                # Auth utilities
```

**Total**: 11 files (9 HTML pages, 2 JS utilities, 1 CSS file)

---

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) - keeps it simple and lightweight
2. **localStorage**: JWT token storage for persistence across page reloads
3. **Role-Based UI**: Show/hide elements based on user role
4. **Client-Side Validation**: Validate before API calls to reduce server load
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for all API failures
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with CSS Grid and Flexbox
7. **Security**: Never log tokens to console, always use HTTPS in production

---

## Integration with Backend

### API Gateway
- All requests go through: `http://localhost:5000`
- Gateway routes to appropriate microservices
- JWT validation at gateway level

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in â†’ receives JWT token
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Token sent in `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Gateway validates token and forwards to services

### Service Ports (Internal)
- UserService: 5002
- CatalogService: 5001
- LoanService: 5003
- Gateway: 5000 (public entry point)

## Testing Checklist

- âœ… Login with correct credentials
- âœ… Login fails with wrong credentials

- âœ… Auto-login after registration

### Catalog
- âœ… Browse all books without login
- âœ… Search by title/author/ISBN
- âœ… Filter by genre
- âœ… View book details
- âœ… Borrow button only shows when logged in

### Loans
- âœ… View active loans
- âœ… View loan history
- âœ… Return book successfully
- âœ… Overdue loans highlighted
- âœ… Requires authentication

### Admin
- âœ… Admin pages require Admin role

- âœ… View all system loans
- âœ… Filter loans by status

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Book Images**: Using placeholder text instead of book covers
2. **Basic Styling**: Functional but not highly polished design
3. **No Pagination**: All books/loans loaded at once (fine for small datasets)
4. **No Real-Time Updates**: Must refresh page to see changes from other users
5. **No Offline Support**: Requires internet connection to API Gateway

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Book cover images
- Advanced search with multiple filters
- Pagination for large datasets
- Real-time notifications (WebSockets)
- Book recommendations
- User profile management
- Fine/penalty tracking
- Email notifications for due dates
- Dark mode toggle
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels)
